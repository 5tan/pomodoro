Pomodoro plugin for Xfce4 panel
===============================

This bash script uses xfce4-genmon-plugin and libnotify to create a simple
Pomodoro timer for Xfce4 panel. After xfce4-genmon-plugin is added to the panel - it should point to the pomodoro.sh script

To configure parameters please go to pomodoro.sh and configure:

size - Icon size in pixels

pomodoro_time - Time for the pomodoro cycle (in minutes)

short_break_time - Time for the short break cycle (in minutes)

long_break_time - Time for the long break cycle (in minutes)
